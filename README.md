The task is to use python to examine the ‘Titanic’ dataset and answer the questions. This dataset includes in-formation about the passengers aboard the transatlantic passenger ship, the ‘Titanic’, which tragically sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912. Each row of the dataset represents one passenger, and provides information on a whether the passenger survived the sinking of the ship, and characteristics of the passenger and their trip, such as their age at the time; the class of ticket they held; the fare they paid; and the place they boarded the ship.<br/>

## Questions
The questions are:<br/>
a) What proportion of passengers embarked at Southampton?<br/>
b) Plot and describe the distribution of passengers by age. Did this vary by the class of ticket?<br/>
c) Were first class passengers more likely to survive?<br/>
d) Were males or females more likely to survive?<br/>
e) For which variables in the dataset are data missing? How might this affect the answers to the questions above?<br/>

## Results
a) What proportion of passengers embarked at Southampton?<br/>
The outcome reveals that 72.44% of passengers boarded from Southampton. <br/><br/>

b) Plot and describe the distribution of passengers by age. Did this vary by the class of ticket?<br/>

Upon examining the graphs, it is evident that the majority of passengers fall within their 20s and 30s. Additionally, in the second graphs we can observe that the second and third class passage relatively younger than the first class.<br/><br/>

c) Were first class passengers more likely to survive?<br/>
The analysis shows that first-class passengers are more likely to survive, as the number of survivors in this class exceeds the number of non-survivors.<br/><br/>

d) Were males or females more likely to survive?<br/>
The findings indicate that females are more likely to survive, as the count of female survivors surpasses that of non-survivors. Conversely, among males, the number of non-survivors is higher than the count of survivors.<br/><br/>

e) For which variables in the dataset are data missing? How might this affect the answers to the questions above?<br/>
A calculation for missing values is performed before sorting it from highest to lowest. Notably, there are several missing values in the dataset, including 688 instances where deck information is absent, 177 cases with missing passenger age information, and 2 instances lacking information on the embarked town.
It is essential to note that the missing information regarding the embarked town could influence the accuracy of the answer to the first question. Similarly, the absence of passenger age information may impact the reliability of the answer to the second question.<br/><br/>
