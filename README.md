# Titanic

---

The task is to use python to examine the ‘Titanic’ dataset and answer the questions. This dataset includes in-formation about the passengers aboard the transatlantic passenger ship, the ‘Titanic’, which tragically sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912. Each row of the dataset represents one passenger, and provides information on a whether the passenger survived the sinking of the ship, and characteristics of the passenger and their trip, such as their age at the time; the class of ticket they held; the fare they paid; and the place they boarded the ship.<br/>

The questions are:<br/>
a) What proportion of passengers embarked at Southampton?<br/>
b) Plot and describe the distribution of passengers by age. Did this vary by the class of ticket?<br/>
c) Were first class passengers more likely to survive?<br/>
d) Were males or females more likely to survive?<br/>
e) For which variables in the dataset are data missing? How might this affect the answers to the questions above?<br/>
